## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**PyTorch must be installed before installing omnivoice-server.** The correct PyTorch variant depends on your hardware:

```bash
# CPU only (works everywhere, but slow)
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) - recommended for production
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Apple Silicon (MPS) - currently broken, use CPU instead
# See docs/verification/MPS_ISSUE.md for details
```

For other CUDA versions or more options, see the [official PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Installation

```bash
# Option 1: Install from PyPI (recommended)
pip install omnivoice-server

# Option 2: Install with uv (faster)
uv tool install omnivoice-server

# Option 3: Install from GitHub (latest development version)
pip install git+https://github.com/maemreyo/omnivoice-server.git

# Option 4: Clone and install locally for development
git clone https://github.com/maemreyo/omnivoice-server.git
cd omnivoice-server
pip install -e .
```

### Start the Server

```bash
# Basic usage (downloads model on first run)
omnivoice-server

# With custom settings
omnivoice-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8880 --device cuda

# With authentication
export OMNIVOICE_API_KEY="your-secret-key"
omnivoice-server
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8880` by default.

## ⚠️ Verification Status

**Last Updated**: 2026-04-04
**Status**: ✅ Working (CPU only)

### Quick Summary

- ✅ **System works** - Produces clear, high-quality audio for English and Vietnamese
- ❌ **MPS broken** - Apple Silicon GPU has PyTorch bugs, use CPU instead
- ⚠️ **CPU slow** - RTF=4.92 (5x slower than real-time, ~10s per voice)
- ✅ **No memory leaks** - Stable memory usage verified

### Benchmark Results (CPU)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Latency (mean) | 10.2 seconds | ⚠️ Slow |
| RTF (Real-Time Factor) | 4.92 | ⚠️ 5x slower than real-time |
| Memory leak | None | ✅ Stable |
| Audio quality | Excellent | ✅ Clear speech |

### Production Recommendation

**For production, deploy on NVIDIA GPU (CUDA):**
- 20-25x faster than CPU (RTF~0.2)
- Cloud options: AWS g5.xlarge (~$1/hr), GCP T4/V100, RunPod (~$0.40/hr)

**Detailed reports**: See [`docs/verification/`](./docs/verification/) for full verification results and technical details.

### Audio Samples

Listen to verified voice samples:

**English (Female, American accent)** - 199KB

[Download English sample](https://github.com/maemreyo/omnivoice-server/releases/download/v0.1.0/test_english.wav)

**Vietnamese (Female)** - 203KB

[Download Vietnamese sample](https://github.com/maemreyo/omnivoice-server/releases/download/v0.1.0/test_vietnamese.wav)

### First Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "omnivoice",
    "input": "Hello, this is OmniVoice text-to-speech!",
    "voice": "auto"
  }' \
  --output speech.wav
```

## API Usage

### Basic Synthesis

```python
import httpx

response = httpx.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "model": "omnivoice",
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "auto",
        "response_format": "wav"
    }
)

with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

### Voice Design

Specify voice attributes to design a custom voice:

```python
response = httpx.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "model": "omnivoice",
        "input": "This voice has specific attributes.",
        "voice": "design:female,british accent,young adult,high pitch"
    }
)
```

Available attributes:
- **Gender**: male, female

- **Style**: whisper
- **Accent (English)**: American, British, Australian, Indian, Irish
- **Dialect (Chinese)**: 四川话, 陕西话, 粤语, 闽南话

### Voice Cloning

#### Option 1: Save a Profile (Reusable)

```python
# Create a profile
with open("reference.wav", "rb") as f:
    response = httpx.post(
        "http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1/voices/profiles",
        data={
            "profile_id": "my_voice",
            "ref_text": "This is the reference text."
        },
        files={"ref_audio": f}
    )

# Use the profile
response = httpx.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "model": "omnivoice",
        "input": "This uses my cloned voice.",
        "voice": "clone:my_voice"
    }
)
```

#### Option 2: One-Shot Cloning

```python
with open("reference.wav", "rb") as f:
    response = httpx.post(
        "http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1/audio/speech/clone",
        data={
            "text": "This is one-shot cloning.",
            "ref_text": "Reference text."
        },
        files={"ref_audio": f}
    )
```

### Streaming

Stream audio in real-time for lower latency:

```python
with httpx.stream(
    "POST",
    "http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "model": "omnivoice",
        "input": "Long text to stream...",
        "voice": "auto",
        "stream": True
    }
) as response:
    for chunk in response.iter_bytes():
        # Process PCM audio chunks
        play_audio(chunk)
```

See `examples/streaming_player.py` for a complete example.

## Docker Deployment

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

```bash
# Start the server
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the server
docker-compose down
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8880`. Voice profiles are persisted in the `./profiles` directory.

### Build and Run Manually

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t omnivoice-server .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  -p 8880:8880 \
  -v $(pwd)/profiles:/app/profiles \
  -e OMNIVOICE_API_KEY=your-secret-key \
  --name omnivoice \
  omnivoice-server

# View logs
docker logs -f omnivoice
```

### Configuration

Set environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` or pass them with `-e`:

- `OMNIVOICE_HOST=0.0.0.0` - Bind host (must be 0.0.0.0 in Docker)
- `OMNIVOICE_PORT=8880` - Server port
- `OMNIVOICE_DEVICE=cpu` - Device (cpu, cuda)
- `OMNIVOICE_NUM_STEP=32` - Inference steps
- `OMNIVOICE_API_KEY=secret` - Optional authentication

For CUDA GPU support, see comments in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/maemreyo/omnivoice-server.git
cd omnivoice-server

# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=omnivoice_server --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_streaming.py -v
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint
ruff check omnivoice_server/ tests/

# Format
ruff format omnivoice_server/ tests/

# Type check
mypy omnivoice_server/
```

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow runs on every push:
- Linting (ruff)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Tests (pytest)
- Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12

## Hardware Requirements

- **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **GPU**:
  - ✅ **NVIDIA GPU with CUDA** - Recommended for production (20-25x faster than CPU)
  - ❌ **Apple Silicon (MPS)** - Currently broken due to PyTorch bugs, do not use
  - ✅ **CPU** - Works but slow (5x slower than real-time)
- **Storage**: 3GB for model cache

### Device Comparison

| Device | Audio Quality | Speed (RTF) | Status |
|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| CPU | ✅ Excellent | 4.92 (slow) | Use for dev |
| MPS (Apple Silicon) | ❌ Broken | N/A | Do not use |
| CUDA (NVIDIA GPU) | ✅ Excellent | ~0.2 (fast) | Use for prod |

**Note**: Default device is now `cpu` due to MPS issues. See [`docs/verification/MPS_ISSUE.md`](./docs/verification/MPS_ISSUE.md) for technical details.

## Performance

**Verified benchmark results (CPU, num_step=32):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Latency | 10.2 seconds per voice |
| RTF (Real-Time Factor) | 4.92 |
| Memory | Stable, no leaks |

**Expected performance on different hardware:**

| Hardware | num_step | Latency (short text) | RTF |
|----------|----------|---------------------|-----|
| CPU (Intel i7) | 32 | ~10s | 4.92 |
| GPU (RTX 3090) | 32 | ~0.5s | ~0.2 |
| Apple M1 Max (MPS) | 32 | ❌ Broken audio | N/A |

Streaming mode reduces perceived latency by sending audio as soon as the first sentence is ready.

## Troubleshooting

### Model Download Issues

The model is downloaded from HuggingFace on first run. If you encounter issues:

```bash
# Pre-download the model
python -c "from omnivoice import OmniVoice; OmniVoice.from_pretrained('k2-fsa/OmniVoice')"

# Or use a local model
omnivoice-server --model-id /path/to/local/model
```

### CUDA Out of Memory

Reduce concurrent requests or use CPU:

```bash
omnivoice-server --max-concurrent 1 --device cpu
```

### Audio Quality Issues

Increase inference steps for better quality:

```bash
omnivoice-server --num-step 32
```
