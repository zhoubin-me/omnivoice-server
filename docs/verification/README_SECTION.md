# Verification Status

**Last Updated**: 2026-04-04
**Status**: ✅ Working (CPU only)

## Quick Summary

- ✅ **System works** - Produces clear, high-quality audio
- ❌ **MPS broken** - Apple Silicon GPU has PyTorch bugs, use CPU instead
- ⚠️ **CPU slow** - 57s per voice (vs 5s on CUDA GPU)

## Test Results

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Server startup | ✅ 17s |
| English voices | ✅ Clear |
| Vietnamese voices | ✅ Clear |
| MPS device | ❌ Broken audio |
| CPU device | ✅ Working |

## Configuration

```python
# omnivoice_server/config.py
device = "cpu"        # Changed from "auto" due to MPS bug
num_step = 32         # Upstream recommended (not 16)
```

## Sample Audio

- `voice_samples/test_english.wav` - Female American accent
- `voice_samples/test_vietnamese.wav` - Vietnamese female voice

## Production Recommendation

Deploy on **NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)** for production:
- 10-20x faster than CPU
- Cloud options: AWS g5.xlarge, GCP T4/V100, RunPod
